# Visualize And Compare Gene Functions In Your Meta-omics Data

Greetings! 

I've pulled together and spruced up data from a variety of functional databases. 
These are the instructions explaining:
1. how to do advanced key word search and counts in Excel, and 
2. how to do some very neat visualizations of the processed functions
 
If you have NGS reads, I STRONGLY recommend you run them through one of my meta-omics pipeline: 
- Metatranscriptome: https://github.com/TealFurnholm/Metatranscriptome
- Metagenome: https://github.com/TealFurnholm/Teals_Strain-Level_Metagenome_Pipeline/wiki/

These pipelines use a universal reference database that links the gene's source organism(s) with their gene functions, and uses the whole community information to streamline the data.

Good luck!
